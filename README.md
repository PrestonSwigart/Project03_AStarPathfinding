# Project03_AStarPathfinding
To run this project, you need to install pygame.
This project uses A* pathfinding to navigate a grid with a custom start, end, and barriers created by the user.
This was done while following this (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtiK0DOeI4A) tutorial from Tech With Tim
which was incredibly helpful in learning how it works and why.
Since diagonal movement was disabled, I used manhattan distance for my heuristics.
